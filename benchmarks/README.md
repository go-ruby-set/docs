# `go-ruby-set` library-level benchmark harness

Reproducible, cross-runtime benchmark of the **pure-Go `go-ruby-set` library**
against the reference Ruby runtimes (MRI, MRI + YJIT, JRuby, TruffleRuby). It
measures the **library primitive** through its Go API, isolated from the rbgo
interpreter, so the numbers answer: *is the pure-Go implementation as fast as the
reference runtime's own `set`?*

## Layout

- `go/`          — self-contained Go driver; `go.mod` pins the published library.
- `ruby/set.rb`  — the equivalent workload; `ruby/_harness.rb` is the shared timer.
- `run.sh`       — runs every available runtime and prints one Markdown table per
  sub-benchmark (ns/op + ratio vs MRI).

## Run

```sh
bash benchmarks/run.sh
```

Environment knobs: `OUTER` (timed passes, default 25), `WARM` (untimed warm-up
passes, default 3), and `RUBY`/`JRUBY`/`TRUFFLERUBY` to select runtime binaries.

## Method

Each process runs `WARM` untimed passes (to let the JVM/GraalVM JITs warm up),
then `OUTER` timed passes of a fixed inner loop, timed with a monotonic clock;
the **best** pass is reported as **ns/op**. Interpreter start-up is outside the
timed region. The Go driver and the Ruby script build **identical inputs** (same
deterministic buffer / document / matrix) and their outputs are checked identical
to MRI before timing. Results are published, dated, in `../docs/performance.md`.
